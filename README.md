# Jeff

Jeff is a game developed in less than 24 hours during a Game Jam on the theme of "Party Games".

It is developed in Java with [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/).

It is a playable game for 2 to 4 players (but the demonstration of this game works with only one player). Each player must have a controller.

Due to the short time available for the development of this game, bugs can be encountered.

## Launch the game

To launch the game you must have **Java 1.8** installed and connect all the controllers before.

### Adding and removing player

If you have multiple controllers you can add or remove other players with LB and RB (L1 or R1) keys.
